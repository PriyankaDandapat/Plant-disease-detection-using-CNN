* Developed a Plant Disease Detection System: Built a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify plant diseases from leaf images, with data preprocessing and normalization for optimal training.
* Streamlit Web App Integration: Created an interactive web application using Streamlit to allow users to upload plant leaf images and get predictions on disease status.
* Docker Containerization: Deployed the model and web application in a Docker container for better environment management and easy deployment, including handling dependencies using Dockerfiles.
* Kaggle Dataset Utilization: Used a Kaggle dataset for training the CNN model, ensuring efficient data handling by securely setting up Kaggle API credentials.
* Model Training and Metrics: Focused on training the CNN with TensorFlow, achieving good accuracy through optimized epochs, with the ability to handle complex image data.
* End-to-End Workflow: Implemented an end-to-end system from model creation to deployment, including environment variable management, file handling, and Docker configuration.
